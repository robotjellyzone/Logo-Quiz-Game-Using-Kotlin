# Logo-Quiz-Game-Using-Kotlin

This is the logo quiz app which i created as a part of 30-Days-Of-Koltin program organised by google india.
I developed this app using kotlin as a main language and as i was a novice in kotlin, i am really glad to be a part of this program as i got to learn so much.

In this app, I used the following concepts [which i learnt in this program] :

[x] Layouts (constraint & linear).
[x] Navigation, External Activity (Share).
[x] Activity & Fragments (with lifecycles - using log statements).
[x] DataBinding with ViewModel & LiveData (with Transformation).
[x] Room Database with Coroutines (for storing the scores).
